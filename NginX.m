% now fire up Phy and check these results. There should still be manual
% work to be done (mostly merges, some refinements of contaminated clusters). 
%% AUTO MERGES 
% after spending quite some time with Phy checking on the results and understanding the merge and split functions, 
% come back here and run Kilosort's automated merging strategy. This block
% will overwrite the previous results and python files. Load the results in
% Phy again: there should be no merges left to do (with the default simulation), but perhaps a few splits
% / cleanup. On realistic data (i.e. not this simulation) there will be drift also, which will usually
% mean there are merges left to do even after this step. 
% Kilosort's AUTO merges should not be confused with the "best" merges done inside the
% benchmark (those are using the real ground truth!!!)
